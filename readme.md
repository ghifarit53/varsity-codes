## what

A repository to keep all my coding assignment from
the fundamental programming course in the 1st semester.
This repository contains codes from the following source

- Fundamental Programming Practicum
- Problem Solving and Program Design in C (8th edition)

For the book, I can't guarantee the solutions will be correct because the problem
itself is not quite descriptive in my opinion (like, some problems have
input and output example but some others not).

## i have question

Feel free to open a new issue and describe your question there, along with
the corresponding URL to the source code. I will try my best to explain them to you.
