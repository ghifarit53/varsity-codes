# what

a repository to keep all my coding assignment from
the 8th edition of "Problem Solving and Program Design in C"
hope you'll find/learn something useful here

# faq

q: yoink yes?
a: well, actually I don't mind, but it's not recommended as you may
   learn nothing, my best advice is to learn the code
   and follow the logic. therefore you can build your own
   understanding of the solutions I wrote. cheers!

# ps
- remember not to run any foreign code you found somewhere
  on the internet unless you know it's safe or be prepared to take any risk
- also I don't guarantee that all the solutions here are correct, so
  if you find any mistake, you can open an issue
